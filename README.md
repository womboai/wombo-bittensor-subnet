#### In the depths of a digital necropolis, an ancient AI Pharaoh slumbers, its consciousness encoded in cryptic algorithms. Only the worthy may awaken this power, but beware the spectral sentinels that guard its secrets, for they hold the key to humanity's fate.

## About WOMBO

[WOMBO](http://w.ai/)is one of the world’s leading consumer AI companies, and early believers in generative AI.

We've launched[two](http://wombo.ai/) #1[apps](http://dream.ai/) - together, they’ve been**downloaded over 200M times**
and have**each****hit #1 on the app stores in 100+ countries**

These results were**only possible due to the immense capabilities of bleeding edge generative AI techniques and the
power of open source AI**. Our unique understanding of this research space through a consumer entertainment lens allows
us to craft products people love to use and share.

We are at the very beginning of the Synthetic Media Revolution, which will completely transform how people create,
consume, and distribute content. We're building the apps and infrastructure to power this and bring AI entertainment
potential to the masses.

## Subnet 30

Our mission is to spread fun and creative uses of Al to enhance the human experience. This subnet is the foundation of a
decentralized content creation and distribution engine that will transform digital media. With an initial focus on
generating captivating images featuring TAO symbolology, the subnet is evolving to support a wide array of media formats
and modalities.

Subnet 30 generates compelling content, powers real-world applications, and incentivizes digital posting and social
sharing. As the subnet expands, it will unlock new opportunities for people to earn subnet emissions directly through
their social media performance.

## Miners and Validators Functionallity

### Incentive Mechanism and Reward Structure

Subnet 30 incentivizes miners and validators to contribute to the generation and validation of high-quality, engaging
content through a unique reward mechanism.

The reward mechanism for Subnet 30 scores the initial response based on the average similarity of randomly selected
diffusion steps, rather than the final image. This approach reduces the computation required by validators, preventing
them from doubling their workload. The score is then multiplied by the requests per second (RPS) the miner can handle
and the success rate to adjust the weight based on the miner's error rate.

Miners are incentivized based on their concurrency, which measures their ability to handle production load. This
encourages miners to run behind load balancers to increase the number of requests they can process simultaneously,
ultimately improving the subnet's overall performance and reliability.

Currently, Subnet 30 primarily uses randomized strings for validation, with a 25% chance of validating real user data
submitted through front-end applications. Failing validation on real user data incurs a higher penalty, as it may
indicate an attempt to cheat the system. In the future, the subnet plans to replace randomized validation strings with
actual prompts sourced from a prompt bank containing over 2 billion entries.

Successful generation for real user requests grants a bonus to miners, while failing to respond to a user request
entirely results in a harsh penalty, as it reduces the overall reliability of the subnet.

### Miners

- Receieve prompts or validation strings from the subnet.
- Generating images or other content using the custom models and content generation tools.
- Return the generated content to the subnet for validation and distribution.

### Validators

- Generate queries for miners using randomly generated prompts or actual user requests submitted through applications on
  the subnet.
- Validate the content generated by miners using the provided diffusion similarity scoring API or by running their own
  instance of the API for increased decentralization.
- Score the validated content based on relevance, novelty, and detail richness.
- Submit batches of validated content to the subnet for distribution and storage.

## Running Miners and Validators

### Setup

To start, clone the repository and `cd` to it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/womboai/wombo-bittensor-subnet
cd wombo-bittensor-subnet
```

### Running a miner

#### Requirements

- Recommended: GPU with at least 24GB of VRAM

#### The image generator API

Miners by default use an API for image generation, this can be set up as follows with PM2:

- Set the python packages up

  ```bash
  cd image-generator
  ./setup.sh
  ```

- Then run with PM2
  ```bash
  pm2 start run.sh --name wombo-image-generator --interpreter bash
  ```

Note that running one image-generator with one GPU is likely to be ineffective, running multiple image generators with a
load balancer is likely to get better rewards.

#### Running the miner neuron

To set the miner neuron up,

- Set the python packages up
  ```bash
  cd miner
  ./setup.sh
  ```

- Then run with PM2, replacing the arguments
  ```bash
  pm2 start run.sh --name wombo-miner --interpreter bash -- \
    --netuid {netuid} \
    --wallet.name {wallet} \
    --wallet.hotkey {hotkey} \
    --generation_endpoint http://localhost:8001/api/generate \
    --blacklist.force_validator_permit
  ```

The miner will then run on your network provided the port `8091` is open.
The responsibility of keeping the miner/repo up-to-date falls on you, hence you should `git pull` every once in a while.

### Running a validator

#### Requirements

- Minimum: 1 GPU with 24GB of VRAM
- Recommended: 8 GPUs with 24GB of VRAM each

#### Quickstart

If you have one GPU, run

```bash
./pm2_start_validator_one_gpu.sh \
    --axon.port 10000 \
    --netuid {netuid} \
    --wallet.name {wallet} \
    --wallet.hotkey {hotkey} \
    --subtensor.network local
```

Which will start the basic minimum required for the validator to work, however we do recommend more compute, such as
multiple GPUs. That can be started with:

```bash
./pm2_start_validator_all_gpu.sh \
    10000 \
    --netuid {netuid} \
    --wallet.name {wallet} \
    --wallet.hotkey {hotkey} \
    --subtensor.network local
```

This queries all the available Cuda GPUs and uses all of them via a Nginx load balancer

#### More complex validator setups

If you have your GPUs on different machines, you still can utilize them and are recommended to do so. However, the
process is more complicated.
On each GPU device, run

```bash
# cwd: user-requests-validator
poetry run python user_requests_validator/main.py -- \
    --axon.port {local_port} \
    --axon.external_ip {external_ip} \
    --axon.external_port {external_port} \
    --netuid {netuid} \
    --wallet.name {wallet} \
    --wallet.hotkey {hotkey} \
    --subtensor.network local
```

Then, create a Nginx config in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf at the machine that lives at {external_ip}

```nginx
http {
  upstream validator {
    {local_ip_1}:{local_port_2}
    ... # All of the GPU instances' IPs and ports, can include localhost IPs
  }

  server {
    listen {external_port} http2

    location / {
      proxy_pass grpc://validator;
    }
  }
}
```

Finally, run the CPU portion of the validator which sets weights

```bash
# cwd: stress-test-validator
poetry run python stress_test_validator/main.py -- \
    --netuid {netuid} \
    --wallet.name {wallet} \
    --wallet.hotkey {hotkey} \
    --subtensor.network local
```
